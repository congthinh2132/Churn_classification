# Customer churn behavior

## Overview
This project focuses on developing predictive models to classify and understand customer churn behavior. The aim is to aid in retention strategies and business decision-making by accurately forecasting which customers are likely to churn.

## Objective
The goal is to:
- Develop accurate models to predict customer churn.
- Understand key factors influencing churn to help improve customer retention strategies.

## Approach

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Collection**: Gathered customer data from various sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations related to customer churn using visualization and statistical techniques.

### Model Development and Evaluation
- **Implemented Predictive Models**: Developed and evaluated various machine learning models to predict customer churn, including:
  - XGBoost
  - Logistic Regression
- **Model Tuning**: Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Comparison**: Compared the performance of different models to select the best performing one.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
